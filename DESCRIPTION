Description: NWPM and other Monte Carlo (automated) methods for analysis of Positiron Emission Tomography
    (PET) data. Specifically, for computing maringal likelihoods of
    Bayesian compartmental models; as well as a novel approach to 
    incorporating spatial dependence using the Potts model as a prior.
